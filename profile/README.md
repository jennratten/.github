I blend business strategy, deep technical expertise and passion for innovation to design scalable data platforms, practice guidance and AI-driven solutions. I enjoy building systems that empower both self-service, enterprise and core tech teams, and sharing my knowledge as a **Microsoft Fabric Super User** and by mentoring platform adoptions.
