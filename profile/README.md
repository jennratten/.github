With a background that bridges business strategy and technical architecture, I bring a unique blend of strategic vision and hands-on technical expertise to every project. My career began on the business side, which gives me a deep understanding of how to align data solutions with real-world goalsâ€”and how to communicate effectively across all levels of an organization.

My roots in business give me a strong sense of what stakeholders need, while my technical experience allows me to architect solutions that deliver. I specialize in designing and managing scalable data platforms, overseeing infrastructure, and driving innovation through AI, automation, and analytics. I love building systems that empower teams, and Iâ€™m equally passionate about sharing what I learn through blogging, workshops, and community engagement.
